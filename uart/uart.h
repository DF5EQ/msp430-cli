/*************************************************************************
This module can be used to transmit and receive data through the built in UART.

An interrupt is generated when the UART has finished transmitting or
receiving a byte. The interrupt handling routines use circular buffers
for buffering received and transmitted data.

UART_RX_BUFFER_SIZE and UART_TX_BUFFER_SIZE define the size of the
circular buffers in bytes. Note that these constants must be a power of 2.

You need to define these buffer sizes as a symbol in your compiler
settings or in uart.h

See README.md for more detailed information.
